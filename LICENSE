	- If you downloaded this resource pack from a different site, better check the links above for the latest releases.
3. Use in screenshots and videos is allowed (and more than welcome!).
  - Please leave credit in the video description (if possible).
4. Use in mod packs must be approved by me and credited in a visible location.
5. Use in a dedicated server mash-up resource pack is allowed if credited within that pack.
